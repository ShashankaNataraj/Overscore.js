# Overscore.js
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShashankaNataraj/Overscore.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ShashankaNataraj/Overscore.js)

A re implementation of underscore js library in ES6 for my practice.

* Implemented without looking at underscore JS' source code
* Focus is on optimizing implementations and performance
* TDD

Thanks to @tkmagesh for this idea!
